Description :

This AddOn lets rogues buy poison components with one command or using the BuyPoison UI. 
This will also allow you to automaticly restock a chosen amount of Flashpowder into your inventory.

==================================================================
/bp wpX Y 	Buy Components for Y Level X Wound Poison
/bp cpX Y 	Buy Components for Y Level X Crippling Poison
/bp dpX Y 	Buy Components for Y Level X Deadly Poison
/bp mpX Y 	Buy Components for Y Level X Mind-numbing Poison
/bp ipX Y 	Buy Components for Y Level X Instant Poison
/bp ap1 Y  Buy Components for Y Agitating Poison
/bp fp Y Buy Y Flash Powder
e.g. "/bp wp3 10" will buy all components needed for 10 lots of 
	level 3 Wound Poison.
Warning: Using anything but multiples of 5 will not handle Vial 
Numbers properly as they can only be bought in multiples of 5 from stores.

Automaticly Purchase Flashpowder every time you are at a vendor: 
/bp rfp 0    -Turns off FlashPowder Auto Restock
/bp rfp Y    -Turns on FlashPowder Auto Restock for Y FlashPowder
